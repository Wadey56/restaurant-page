              Delicious in Diner was founded by our very own Chef Senshi. He has
              been serving up delicious meals to adventurers since 2014. His
              passion for both cooking and the dungeon has inspired the great
              menu of alternative ingredient meals and BYOI services. All our
              ingredients are sourced from local adventurers and the menu is
              pre-approved by his trusty party of mixed characters to appeal to
              the wider community.
