            Here at our diner we know real energy is created from eating
            delicious lunches and not from collecting floating orbs of XP; so
            come visit Delicious in Diner to rest up and level-up for that weary
            journey ahead.

            try our low level relished meals such as the Golum Field Fresh
            Veggie Lunch or dare your guts with our high level spiced platters
            like our Dwarf-Style Stir Fry-whatever your seasoning skillset, we
            won't judge!
